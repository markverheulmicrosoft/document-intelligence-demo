# Architecture: Azure Document Intelligence PDF Analyzer

This document outlines the architecture of the PDF Analyzer web application, which extracts data from PDF documents and enables users to visually verify the source of the extracted information within the original document.

## 1. Why This Approach?

### The Document Data Extraction Challenge

Extracting structured data from unstructured documents like PDFs is a complex problem that organizations have struggled with for decades. Traditional approaches like:

- **OCR-only solutions** extract text but lose structure and positioning
- **Template-based systems** work well only for fixed layouts and break with minor variations
- **Rules-based extraction** requires extensive maintenance as document formats evolve
- **General-purpose LLMs** can extract text but struggle with precise field identification and lack coordinate information

For a truly robust solution, we needed capabilities beyond basic text extraction:

1. **Structural understanding** of diverse document formats
2. **Accurate field extraction** with consistent labeling
3. **Precise positional information** for visual verification
4. **Production-grade reliability** for business workflows

### Why Azure Document Intelligence?

After evaluating multiple solutions, Azure Document Intelligence emerged as the superior choice for several key reasons:

1. **Purpose-built AI models**: Unlike general text extraction or OCR tools, Document Intelligence uses specialized deep learning models trained on millions of documents, optimized specifically for understanding document layouts and extracting structured information.

2. **Coordinate precision**: The crucial feature for our highlighting functionality is Document Intelligence's ability to return exact polygonal coordinates for every extracted field. Other solutions either don't provide this data or return less precise bounding boxes.

3. **Prebuilt domain-specific models**: Rather than building our own models for common document types, we can leverage Microsoft's prebuilt models for invoices, receipts, IDs, etc., which have been trained on vast, diverse datasets.

4. **Extensibility**: For custom document types, Document Intelligence allows training custom models through a simple no-code interface in Document Intelligence Studio.

5. **Enterprise-grade service**: As a managed Azure service, it offers the reliability, compliance, and security features required for production business applications.

### Why PDF.js for Rendering?

For the document viewing component, Mozilla's PDF.js emerged as the ideal solution because:

1. **Open-source and widely used**: Battle-tested in millions of browsers as the default PDF renderer in Firefox
2. **Client-side processing**: Doesn't require sending documents to third-party services
3. **Canvas-based rendering**: Provides complete control over visual elements, enabling our custom highlight overlays
4. **Viewport coordinate system**: Offers sophisticated APIs for coordinate transformations
5. **No external dependencies**: Eliminates security and compliance concerns of third-party services

The combination of Azure Document Intelligence and PDF.js creates a solution greater than the sum of its parts, enabling a seamless user experience with both accurate data extraction and visual verification.

## 2. System Overview

The application consists of a Flask backend and HTML/JavaScript frontend with the following key components:

![Architecture Overview: Frontend (HTML/JS/PDF.js) ←→ Backend (Flask) ←→ Azure Document Intelligence]

### Components

1. **Frontend**
   - HTML/JavaScript-based web interface
   - PDF.js for PDF rendering and highlighting
   - Split-screen UI showing extracted data and PDF document

2. **Backend**
   - Flask web server providing:
     - Static file serving (HTML, JavaScript, default PDFs)
     - RESTful API endpoint for document analysis
   - Direct file processing (no intermediate blob storage)

3. **Azure Document Intelligence**
   - Cloud-based document analysis service
   - Provides structured data extraction with bounding box coordinates
   - Uses the prebuilt invoice model by default

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Document Upload & Rendering**
   - User uploads a PDF or uses the default document
   - Frontend loads the PDF using PDF.js
   - Document is rendered in the PDF viewer area

2. **Document Analysis**
   - User initiates analysis by clicking "Analyze Document"
   - Frontend sends the PDF to the backend via an AJAX POST request
   - Backend processes the PDF using Azure Document Intelligence
   - Backend converts the results to a JSON-serializable format
   - Structured data (including field values and bounding box coordinates) is returned to the frontend

3. **Visualization & Verification**
   - Frontend displays the extracted fields in a structured format
   - When a user clicks on an extracted field, the application:
     - Retrieves the bounding box coordinates for that field
     - Renders the appropriate page of the PDF
     - Draws a highlight overlay on the PDF using the coordinates

## 4. Key Technologies

### Frontend

- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: Core application logic
- **PDF.js**: Mozilla's PDF rendering library
- **Fetch API**: For HTTP requests to the backend

### Backend

- **Flask**: Python web framework
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support
- **Azure SDK for Python**: Communication with Azure Document Intelligence

### Cloud Services

- **Azure Document Intelligence**: Document analysis with the following capabilities:
  - Text extraction with positional data
  - Field identification and classification
  - Confidence scoring
  - Bounding box/polygon coordinates for visual mapping

## 5. Coordinate System & Highlighting

A key technical aspect of this application is the coordinate conversion between different systems:

1. **Azure Document Intelligence Coordinates**:
   - Returned as polygons in the response
   - Based on inches from the top-left corner of the page
   - Format: `[x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4]` (four corners of a quadrilateral)

2. **PDF Coordinate System**:
   - PDF.js uses "PDF points" (1/72 inch) with origin at bottom-left
   - Conversion from Azure coordinates requires:
     - Multiplying by 72 (converting inches to points)
     - Flipping the Y-axis (Azure: top-down, PDF: bottom-up)

3. **Canvas Coordinate System**:
   - Final drawing happens on an HTML canvas
   - PDF.js viewport handles conversion from PDF points to canvas pixels

The `handleLocationClick` function in `script.js` implements this coordinate transformation to accurately highlight text regions.

## 6. Business Value
