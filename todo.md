I want that work on a sort of bigger pipeline kind of thing where when i upload a file, i run the document intelligence to fetch all the images in the pdf and all the text with the page number and polygon info per sentence. Then i think i kind of want to save these in a sort of dictionary per page so that later i can highlight the lines of text where the LLM found them when we do extract certain values from the document. Also i want all the images to be found by the doc intelligence and the images to be converted into text. How could we approach this?
